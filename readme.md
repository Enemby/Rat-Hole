# Made by Enemby
I made this game in about 24-30 hours, for the 48 hour
Utah Indie Game Jam (2015).
I also made it for Indie Speed run.
Everything in the game (besides the engine, ofc) was made by me.

# How to build
You should run this with Unity 5.0.0f4. It'll probably run okay above that, but no promises.
I would not suggest reading this code to learn, since it's probably the worst code I've written in a few years (and there's a lot of it).
##Controls
	WASD- Movement. W/s to move forward, A/D to turn.
	Space- Firing.
	CTRL - Jumping.
	ESC- Quit to menu.
# Premise
It's kind of unclear, even for me, but this is the
description on the Itch.io page.
"A film noir detective searches an office filled with 
bad guys for an important "Confidential" document. 
It doesn't make a lot of sense, to be honest."
So... yeah. I got a little confused.
